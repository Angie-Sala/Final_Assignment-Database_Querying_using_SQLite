This project is part of my coursework for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera.
In this assignment, I work with real Chicago datasets and use Python, SQL, and SQLite inside a Jupyter Notebook to analyze trends in census data, public school performance, and crime statistics.


## Project Objectives

1. Load raw CSV datasets into an SQLite database.
2. Perform SQL queries to explore and extract insights.
3. Analyze relationships between census information, school performance, and crime patterns.
4. Demonstrate integration of SQL with Python and Pandas for data analysis.


## Problem Description

Three datasets are provided:

| Dataset                  | Description                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| CENSUS_DATA              | Census information for Chicago community areas      |
| CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS   | Performance, safety, and other metrics for public schools |
| CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA       | Crime records and statistics for Chicago           |
